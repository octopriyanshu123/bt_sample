Certainly! Below is the source code for the `SyncActionNode` class based on the provided header. I'll assume a simplified version that includes the core functionality to handle synchronous execution and halting.

### `SyncActionNode` Source Code

```cpp
#include "SyncActionNode.h"  // Include the header file where SyncActionNode is declared

SyncActionNode::SyncActionNode(const std::string& name, const NodeConfiguration& config)
    : ActionNodeBase(name, config)
{
    // Constructor implementation
    // You can initialize any variables here, if needed
}

NodeStatus SyncActionNode::executeTick()
{
    // You can perform the action or task here.
    // For the sake of this example, let's assume this node does some work and returns a status.
    
    // Typically, you would execute some logic here and determine the status
    // For example, if the task is completed, return SUCCESS
    // If the task fails, return FAILURE
    // We throw an error if the node should be in a RUNNING state, as per the original requirement

    if (/* some condition indicating running */)
    {
        throw std::runtime_error("SyncActionNode should not return RUNNING");
    }

    // Example condition to return success or failure (customize based on your logic)
    bool taskSuccess = true;  // Replace with actual logic

    if (taskSuccess)
    {
        return NodeStatus::SUCCESS;
    }
    else
    {
        return NodeStatus::FAILURE;
    }
}

void SyncActionNode::halt()
{
    // The halt method is already defined in the base class as final, so no need to override it
    // You may want to do something specific when halting, like stopping the task
    // For now, this method does nothing.
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Constructor (`SyncActionNode`)**:
   - The constructor takes a `name` and a `config` parameter, which are passed to the parent class `ActionNodeBase` constructor.
   - The constructor doesn't do anything in this simplified version, but you can add initialization logic if needed.

2. **`executeTick()`**:
   - This is the core method of the node. It should execute the action or task that the node represents.
   - In a real-world implementation, this would contain the logic to perform the task (like checking sensors, moving a robot, etc.).
   - The node should **not return `RUNNING`**, and if it does, we throw an error (as per the requirement in the header).
   - Based on the task result (success or failure), it returns either `NodeStatus::SUCCESS` or `NodeStatus::FAILURE`.

3. **`halt()`**:
   - The `halt()` method is marked as `final` in the base class (`ActionNodeBase`), so no additional behavior is required unless you want to add a custom stopping mechanism for the task.
   - In this case, the `halt()` function is just an empty placeholder, meaning no additional cleanup or stopping logic is defined here.

### Things to Consider:

- **Error Handling**: You may want to improve the error handling in `executeTick()`, especially when the node performs an action that may take some time. For example, using timeouts, retries, or more sophisticated failure handling mechanisms could be useful.
  
- **Custom Logic**: The actual logic for success or failure in the `executeTick()` method would depend on the specific task the node is performing. You might replace the `taskSuccess` boolean with your own task logic.

---

### Key Points to Note:
- **Synchronous Node**: Since this is a synchronous action node, once `executeTick()` is called, it must either complete and return `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE` immediately. It cannot return `RUNNING` (which is typically used for asynchronous operations).
  
- **Halt Functionality**: The `halt()` method is intended to stop or cancel the action, but since it's `final` in the base class, it doesn't need to be overridden unless you have specific cancellation logic for the action.

Let me know if you need further details or modifications!

Certainly! Below are notes for various **Control Flow Nodes** used in Behavior Trees (BT), such as `AsyncFallback`, `AsyncSequence`, `ReactiveFallback`, `ReactiveSequence`, `Sequence`, `SequenceWithMemory`, and `Fallback`. These nodes are primarily used to control the flow of the tree's execution, dictating how child nodes are processed.

### 1. **Control Node**
   - **Function**: A general category of nodes that manage the execution flow of child nodes. Control nodes allow for structured behavior like branching, sequencing, and repeating nodes.
   - **Usage**: Used to organize more complex AI behaviors by directing how child nodes are executed. They provide higher-level logic over individual actions.

   **Behavior**:
   - Controls the flow of other nodes.
   - Can contain sequences or fallbacks for decision-making.

---

### 2. **AsyncFallback**
   - **Function**: This node attempts to execute multiple child nodes in sequence, but asynchronously. If one child node fails, it immediately proceeds to the next one.
   - **Usage**: Useful for trying multiple alternatives in an asynchronous manner where the failure of one does not block the next from executing. It’s great for fallback behaviors where you want to attempt several options concurrently.
   - **Example**: A character trying to perform several tasks such as "Attack", "Retreat", or "Find Cover" but not waiting for one to finish before trying the next. If the first attempt fails, the node asynchronously starts the next one.

   **Behavior**:
   - Executes child nodes asynchronously, with the first one that doesn't fail being successful.
   - If any child fails, it moves to the next one immediately.
   
---

### 3. **AsyncSequence**
   - **Function**: Similar to `AsyncFallback`, but with the opposite behavior. It attempts to execute child nodes sequentially, and if one fails, it proceeds to the next node asynchronously.
   - **Usage**: When you want to attempt actions in sequence but allow the failure of one to asynchronously trigger the next, without waiting for the previous one to finish.
   - **Example**: A character performs multiple tasks in a series like "Attack", "Find Target", and "Move to Location". If "Attack" fails, it immediately moves on to the next task without waiting for the current one to finish.

   **Behavior**:
   - Sequential execution of child nodes, but asynchronous in nature.
   - It moves to the next node if the previous one fails.
   
---

### 4. **ReactiveFallback**
   - **Function**: A control node that reacts to failures of its children. It evaluates each child node in order and reacts (by switching to the next child) only when a failure is detected.
   - **Usage**: Best used for a fallback system where you want to attempt different strategies in a reactive manner, starting with the first one and only moving on to the next one if the current strategy fails.
   - **Example**: A character trying multiple paths to escape a threat. If one path fails (e.g., blocked), it reacts by attempting the next path.

   **Behavior**:
   - Starts evaluating from the first child and reacts to failure.
   - If a child node fails, it switches to the next one.
   - Reacts to failures dynamically during runtime.
   
---

### 5. **ReactiveSequence**
   - **Function**: This is similar to `ReactiveFallback` but in the opposite direction. It executes child nodes in sequence and reacts to failures by jumping to the next one immediately.
   - **Usage**: Ideal for situations where you want to try a series of actions in order, reacting to failure in real time. It allows your behavior to adapt based on the status of the previous action.
   - **Example**: A character might attempt to "Move to Target", then "Attack", and if both fail, it attempts the next available sequence, like "Find Cover".

   **Behavior**:
   - Executes children sequentially, moving to the next child if a failure occurs.
   - Reacts dynamically to each failure without waiting for other children to complete.
   
---

### 6. **Sequence**
   - **Function**: A classic control node that executes child nodes in order, one after the other. If any child node fails, the entire sequence fails immediately. If all nodes succeed, the sequence succeeds.
   - **Usage**: Used when you want to perform a series of actions or checks, and the success of each step is required for the whole sequence to succeed.
   - **Example**: A character might perform a "Move to Target", "Attack Target", and then "Loot Item" sequence. If any step fails (e.g., "Move to Target" fails), the entire sequence fails.

   **Behavior**:
   - Executes each child node sequentially.
   - Returns `SUCCESS` only if all child nodes succeed.
   - Returns `FAILURE` as soon as one child node fails.

---

### 7. **SequenceWithMemory**
   - **Function**: A variant of the standard `Sequence`, but it "remembers" the state of previous nodes, even if they fail. This allows for more flexible behavior by preventing re-execution of tasks that previously failed.
   - **Usage**: This is used when you want to ensure that once a task has been evaluated (even if it failed), it will not be retried in the same sequence. It allows for more efficient state management.
   - **Example**: A character might be going through a sequence of actions, such as "Move to Target", "Attack Target", "Loot Item". If "Attack Target" fails, it won't retry that task again, instead moving on to the next sequence.

   **Behavior**:
   - Executes child nodes sequentially, but "remembers" failures.
   - Once a node has failed, it doesn’t retry it in future executions.
   - Returns `SUCCESS` if all nodes succeed; `FAILURE` if any node fails.

---

### 8. **Fallback**
   - **Function**: A control node that tries each child node in order. If one child fails, it moves on to the next one. The first node that succeeds returns `SUCCESS`. If all children fail, it returns `FAILURE`.
   - **Usage**: This is used when you have multiple fallback options, and you want to try them one by one, in a set order, until one succeeds.
   - **Example**: A character might try to "Attack", then "Defend", and if both fail, it will "Retreat" as the final fallback. If all these actions fail, it returns `FAILURE`.

   **Behavior**:
   - Executes each child node in sequence.
   - Returns `SUCCESS` as soon as any child node succeeds.
   - Returns `FAILURE` if all child nodes fail.

---

### Summary of Key Differences:

- **AsyncFallback**: Tries multiple nodes asynchronously, moving to the next child node immediately after a failure.
- **AsyncSequence**: Tries nodes asynchronously in sequence, moving on to the next node if the previous one fails.
- **ReactiveFallback**: Reacts to child node failures and immediately switches to the next node when a failure occurs.
- **ReactiveSequence**: Similar to `ReactiveFallback`, but sequentially attempts child nodes and reacts to failures immediately.
- **Sequence**: Executes child nodes in strict order. Returns `SUCCESS` only if all succeed, and `FAILURE` if any fail.
- **SequenceWithMemory**: Executes child nodes sequentially and remembers past failures to avoid retrying failed tasks.
- **Fallback**: Attempts each child node sequentially, returning `SUCCESS` when one succeeds and `FAILURE` when all fail.

These control flow nodes are fundamental for managing the logic and decision-making process in behavior trees. They allow the AI to handle complex situations, from trying alternative behaviors (`Fallback`) to executing a series of dependent actions (`Sequence`).



In the context of BehaviorTree.CPP, a `CoroActionNode` is a type of action node that allows you to execute actions asynchronously using **coroutines**. Coroutines are functions that can be paused and resumed, making them a useful tool for non-blocking, asynchronous operations.

### Purpose of `CoroActionNode`
The primary purpose of a `CoroActionNode` is to support asynchronous operations, such as waiting for a condition or performing a task over multiple frames, without blocking the main execution thread. This allows a behavior tree to remain responsive and efficient by not waiting synchronously for long-running tasks.

### How it Works
- A `CoroActionNode` essentially performs an action in **multiple stages**.
- Each time its `tick()` method is called, the node can "pause" execution (e.g., wait for a resource, an event, or a condition to be met), and the tree will continue executing other nodes.
- When the node's task is complete or the condition is met, it can "resume" and return a status (e.g., `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, or `RUNNING`).

### Key Points
- **Coroutine Support:** A `CoroActionNode` uses the concept of coroutines (a more modern way of dealing with asynchronous operations in C++) to split its task over time.
- **Asynchronous Behavior:** It allows for asynchronous execution within the behavior tree without blocking the main thread. For example, it could be used for tasks like waiting for a timer, checking for external events, or performing network I/O.
- **Suspended Execution:** When a `CoroActionNode` is running, it doesn't block the tree. It "suspends" its execution until the action can complete, at which point it will continue from where it left off.

### Typical Use Cases
- **Wait for a time duration:** You can use it to simulate waiting for a specific time period before moving to the next action.
- **Check an event asynchronously:** You can use a coroutine to check for external events without blocking the entire tree.
- **Non-blocking tasks:** Performing tasks like animations, data fetching, or other lengthy operations without freezing the tree or other operations.

### Example: `CoroActionNode` for Waiting

```cpp
#include "behaviortree_cpp/action_node.h"
#include <chrono>
#include <thread>

class WaitForTimeNode : public BT::CoroActionNode
{
public:
    WaitForTimeNode(const std::string& name, const BT::NodeConfiguration& config)
        : CoroActionNode(name, config), time_to_wait_(5)
    {
    }

    // Declare the input/output ports
    static BT::PortsList providedPorts()
    {
        return { BT::InputPort<int>("TimeToWait") };
    }

    BT::NodeStatus tick() override
    {
        // Get the input time from the behavior tree, default is 5 seconds
        if (!getInput<int>("TimeToWait", time_to_wait_))
        {
            time_to_wait_ = 5;  // default to 5 seconds if no input
        }

        // Begin the asynchronous "waiting" process (simulate it)
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(time_to_wait_));

        std::cout << "Waited for " << time_to_wait_ << " seconds." << std::endl;

        return BT::NodeStatus::SUCCESS;
    }

private:
    int time_to_wait_;
};
```

### Behavior Tree Usage:

```xml
<BehaviorTree ID="MyTree">
    <Sequence>
        <WaitForTimeNode TimeToWait="3" />
    </Sequence>
</BehaviorTree>
```

In this example, the `WaitForTimeNode` will pause the action for 3 seconds before returning `SUCCESS`. During this pause, other nodes in the behavior tree can continue executing, as the node is asynchronously waiting.

### Summary
A `CoroActionNode` is a specialized type of action node in BehaviorTree.CPP that facilitates asynchronous execution by using coroutines. It allows tasks to run without blocking the rest of the behavior tree, making it suitable for tasks like waiting for events, performing I/O operations, or handling animations, all while keeping the tree responsive.
