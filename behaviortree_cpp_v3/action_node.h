        prev_status = NodeStatus::RUNNING;  // Update prev_status to reflect the change
    }

    // Call the tick functor to execute the action and get the new status
    NodeStatus status = tick_functor_(*this);

    // If the new status is different from the previous status, update the node's status
    if (status != prev_status)
    {
        setStatus(status);  // Update the status to the new status
    }

    // Return the current status of the node (after execution of the tick functor)
    return status;
}
```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Constructor (`SimpleActionNode`)**:
    - The constructor accepts three parameters: 
      - `name`: A string representing the node's name.
      - `tick_functor`: A function (or callable) that defines the action performed by this node when the `tick()` method is called.
      - `config`: The configuration for the node.
    - The constructor calls the base class `SyncActionNode` constructor to initialize it with the provided `name` and `config`.
    - It then stores the `tick_functor` (the function to be executed during the tick) using `std::move` to efficiently transfer ownership of the functor.

2. **`tick()` Method**:
    - This method is called to execute the action associated with the node.
    - **Status Check**: 
      - The current status of the node is checked using `status()`. The `prev_status` variable holds this value before any changes are made.
      - If the current status is `IDLE`, it updates the status to `RUNNING` because the action is about to be executed. The `prev_status` is also updated to `RUNNING` to reflect this change.
    
    - **Execute the Action**: 
      - The `tick_functor_` is called to perform the node's action. The `tick_functor` is expected to return a `NodeStatus` (either `IDLE`, `RUNNING`, or `SUCCESS`, etc.). This value is stored in the `status` variable.
    
    - **Status Update**: 
      - If the new status returned by the `tick_functor_` is different from `prev_status`, the status of the node is updated using `setStatus(status)` to reflect the new status.
    
    - **Return the Status**: 
      - Finally, the current `status` is returned, indicating the result of the action (whether it is still running, finished, or encountered an issue).

### Key Concepts:

- **`tick_functor_`**: This is a function that encapsulates the logic of the action that the node performs. It is a key part of the `SimpleActionNode` because it defines the behavior of the node when `tick()` is invoked.
  
- **Status Management**: The nodeâ€™s status is carefully managed during the execution of the tick. Initially, it may be `IDLE`, and once the action begins, it is set to `RUNNING`. After the action finishes, the status could change to something else based on the result of `tick_functor_`.

- **Functor Pattern**: The use of `TickFunctor` allows for flexible, dynamic behavior, where different instances of `SimpleActionNode` can execute different actions based on the passed functor. This makes the node highly reusable for different tasks. 

In this design, the node does not inherently know the details of the action it is performing; it delegates that responsibility to the functor (`tick_functor_`).

 * @brief The AsyncActionNode uses a different thread, where the action will be

 * IMPORTANT: this action is quite hard to implement correctly. Please be sure that you know what you are doing.
 *
 * - In your overriden tick() method, you must check periodically
 *   the result of the method isHaltRequested() and stop your execution accordingly.
 *
 * - in the overriden halt() method, you can do some cleanup, but do not forget to
 *   invoke the base class method AsyncActionNode::halt();
 *
 * - remember, with few exceptions, a halted AsyncAction must return NodeStatus::IDLE.
 *
 * For a complete example, look at __AsyncActionTest__ in action_test_node.h in the folder test.

### Detailed Explanation in the Comments:

1. **Constructor**: 
   - Initializes the base class `ActionNodeBase` with `name` and `config`.
   - The flags `keep_thread_alive_` and `start_action_` are set to control the thread's behavior and signal when the action should start.
   - A background thread is created and runs the `asyncThreadLoop` method, which handles the asynchronous task.

2. **Destructor**:
   - Ensures that when the `AsyncActionNode` object is destroyed, the background thread is properly joined, meaning the main thread will wait for the background thread to finish.

3. **waitStart()**:
   - The method uses a `std::mutex` to synchronize the start signal.
   - The thread waits until `start_action_` is set to `true`, signaling it to begin execution. This ensures that the background thread only starts its work when signaled.

4. **notifyStart()**:
   - This method is called by the main thread to signal the background thread to begin executing the action.
   - It sets the `start_action_` flag to `true` and notifies the waiting thread using `notify_all()`.

5. **asyncThreadLoop()**:
   - This is the loop running in the background thread. It keeps running as long as `keep_thread_alive_` is `true`.
   - The loop waits for a signal to start the action (`waitStart()`), then calls `tick()` to execute the action.
   - If an exception is thrown during the execution of `tick()`, it is caught, and the thread is stopped by setting `keep_thread_alive_` to `false`.

6. **executeTick()**:
   - This method is called by the main thread to start the execution of the asynchronous action.
   - If the node is `IDLE`, it updates its status to `RUNNING` and signals the background thread to start.
   - It also rethrows any stored exceptions, ensuring that errors propagate correctly.

7. **stopAndJoinThread()**:
   - This method is responsible for stopping the background thread and ensuring it finishes before the object is destroyed.
   - It sets `keep_thread_alive_` to `false`, signaling the background thread to stop, and calls `notifyStart()` to wake up the thread and let it handle the stop request.
   - If the thread is still running, it is joined, meaning the main thread will wait for the background thread to finish.

### Summary of Key Concepts:

- **Thread Synchronization**: The code uses `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable` to synchronize the main thread and the background thread. The main thread signals the background thread to start processing, and the background thread waits for that signal.
  
- **Exception Handling**: If an exception occurs in the background thread during the execution of `tick()`, it is caught, stored, and used to stop the thread gracefully.

- **Thread Lifecycle Management**: The background thread is properly managed by ensuring it is joined when the object is destroyed, preventing potential issues like dangling threads.
